Courses had inconsistent representaions for credits, e.g. (3 cr. / 1-3 cr. / 2-3 cr. each / 3 cr. + 1 cr. lab / 3 cr. per semester / 1 cr. per production / 1, 2, or 3 cr.)

I decided to go with the higher credit number for courses with credits like 1-3 cr. and  2-3 cr. each.
Add the number of credits for courses like 3 cr. + 1 cr.
And just have the number of credits for courses like 3 cr. per semester and 1 cr. per production.

Thus 
  - 1-3 cr. becomes 3 cr. 
  - 2-3 cr. each becomes 3 cr.
  - 3 cr. + 1 cr. lab becomes 4 cr.
  - 1 cr. per production becomes 1 cr.
  - 1, 2, or 3 cr. becomes 3 cr.


For Concurrent prerequisites, I assumed that if the word 'concurrent' was mentioned in the prerequistes, all prerequisites are concurrent as the catalog didn't follow a good schema on how to define if a course is concurrent.
